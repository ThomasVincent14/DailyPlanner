# <My Daily Planner>
## Description
The motivation for this app is to help stay organized throughout the day. I built this to brush up on my skills in Javascript and to expreiment more with some of the funtions Javascript has to offer. The daily planner solves the problem of forgetting important tasks throughout your day when you get busy. I learned that JQuery is a lifesaver and saves me so much time when it comes to designing my layout.

## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
The steps required to install this project include a css, javascript and html file. Since we recently learned about JQUERY and how it allows us to design our webpage, I figured the CSS file wouldn't be a heavy focus for this project. Within the HTML however, I included a Bootstrap, Jquery and Fontawesome link so I could include things such as a jumbotron for my text or get the font I wanted. Next I worked on the javascript and one of the most important things I used was the for loop. The for loops help to display the time, I also made text boxes that saved inputs for the day and depending on what hour of the day it is the box will turn red.
## Usage
My daily planner is very straightforward, click on what hour you want to input your task for the day and save it. The time and date changes accordingly.
